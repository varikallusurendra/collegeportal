You are a full-stack developer. Help me build a "Training and Placement Portal" for my college using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The portal is accessible only by a Training and Placement Officer (TPO) through a login-protected admin panel.

✅ Requirements:

1. TPO Login Page:
   - Simple login with username and password (JWT-based auth)
   - No user registration needed, just hardcoded admin credentials

2. Home Page (Public):
   - Sections for Latest News, Events, and Upcoming Events
   - Each event should have a type: past, ongoing, or upcoming
   - Ongoing events must have a button/link to mark attendance

3. Attendance System:
   - Ongoing events generate a link where students can mark attendance (name, roll number)
   - TPO should be able to export attendance to Excel

4. Admin Dashboard (TPO Only):
   - Add/Edit/Delete News, Events, and Upcoming Events
   - For Events:
     - Upload placement results
     - For each student: name, roll number, photo, selected (yes/no), company name
     - If selected = yes → show offer letter link
     - If selected = no → show "Not selected"
   - Export results in Excel

5. Alumni Registration:
   - Visible on the public homepage next to upcoming events
   - Form fields:
     - Name, Roll No, Pass Out Year, Higher Education College Name, College Roll No, Address with Pincode, Contact Number, Email
   - Data to be stored in MongoDB
   - Admin panel should have Excel export option for alumni data

6. Student Info Upload:
   - Admin uploads student details with:
     - Name, Roll No, ID card image, Offer Letter (if available)
   - Export to PDF or Excel from dashboard

7. UI:
   - Use React with Tailwind CSS
   - Responsive design with a clean and intuitive dashboard
   - Home Page should be public, dashboard secured

8. Export Logic:
   - Use xlsx or SheetJS for Excel export
   - Use jsPDF or pdfmake for PDF export

9. Hosting:
   - Host frontend using Replit React App
   - Host backend with Node.js + Express (use Express Router)
   - MongoDB Atlas for cloud database
